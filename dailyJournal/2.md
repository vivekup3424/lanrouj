1. "424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement /leetcode"

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string 
and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation 
at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get 
after performing the above operations.

So here is my approach, writing as simpler as I can

```
create a hashmap to store frequency of each letter
start = 0, end = 0
store frequency of substring from start to end
```

## Problems done today
2. Min-Stack Problem
Given a class MinStack, I have to design it to 
perform 4 operations in constant time complexity
    - push() 
    - pop()
    - top()
    - getMin() returns the min element in constant time

    * Approach One was to design the stack to hold pairs first element would the current element,
    and the second element would the minimum element encountered so far
    * Leetcode himself was not able to provide any more optimal approach
    * But people were telling me that it can be done using some mathematics(hashing)
    with a single element and single stack i.e. not storing pairs in the stack

3. Daily Temperatures
I maintained a monotonically decreasing stack here, since for a 
given value, I needed to get the next higher value after it
so by maintaining a monoto. decreasing stack I am storing all the
small values, and if I see a greater value after these values
I would be able to answer the question using the position of this
higher value.

**For now I am coding the listening to coldplay.**
