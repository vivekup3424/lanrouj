## Week 1
2024-11-11

I missed 2 classes today of FIT and BDA, I shouldn't have.
I will try to not fuck up my future.
# Week 1

2024-12-06
My attempt at keeping at consistent journal and list of things to do.
- I am trying to learn how to create a tcp server in c (//\:-:/ let's start with this for now)

2024-12-07
- Today I am working on developing a Game-Of-Life program with animation for terminal. (I have added the code in leetcode/python section)

2024-12-08
- I am thinking of implementing the boids algorithm in python.

# Week 2
2024-12-25

## Progress on implement git on my own
Things I have observed that git does
1. When installing for the time on our system it looks for user.name and user.email on a .gitconfig file of the ~/ space, this can be set up by  `git config user.name = <something> `

2024-12-27
Today I spent money on rapido of 27 rupees, 50 for toothpaste and toothbrush and 70 rupees for egg roll
I am regretting buying the egg roll, as I didn't like its taste too oily for me

2024-12-28
The time is 00:00 for now I am thinking of revisting the dp problems since I am significantly weak

2024-12-29
I am going to solve 10 problems today of DP, and also I am going to take the train on 30th Dakshin Express.
By solving a problem, I mean studying everything there is to know about these problems

 Problems:-
 1.[[Longest Valid Parentheses]]
 2.[[Min Cost Climbing Stairs]]
 I solved two more questions from GFG contest, I am going to count them too.
 Now I have to solve 10 - 4 = 6 more questions
5. [[Maximize The Cut Segments]] - DP Shit
6. [[Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary]]
7. [[Intersection of Two arrays with Duplicate Elements]]
8. [[Max Possible Bitwise AND]]

I am at a problem
1. I will reach Gwalior on 31st since I am going via train, it would take me a solid full Monday to reach Gwalior
2. I also want to apply for the scholarship so it could happen that I may have to stay for multiple days
3. But even if I don't stay for more days, if I try to come back on 1st in the evening, I would still be missing work on 31st, 1st and 2nd
4. But if I ask my boss for remote then I would be able to do my work remote for 1st, 2nd and 3rd
5. And then safely come back in the weeknd
6. Let's see I would have to talk to Akhil about this.

Anyways for now I still have 2 more questions for me to do and the time is 23:04

*2025-01-09*
So many things have happened its been 4 days since I came back from college.
I have busy doing  my job at the keus startup, things have ramped up there starting from january.
I am feeling a little bit mentally exhausted today, but nothing very difficult. I will take everything as a lesson, will enjoy the job that I am doing there.

**23:08**
Luckily I've managed to solve today's daily question of Leetcode and GFG easily. I don't know why I am zoning out so much.

I finding difficulty multi-tasking.


*2025-02-21*
So here's a idea I have thought of on how to make this obsidian setup more easier to access for me, 
1. install termux on android 
2. install git on termux
3. config user.name and user.email on termux
4. clone my repo ( I am thinking of adding a cron-job here to clone the, but I dont if I am gonna need this)
5. install obsidian and open the repo from there
now let's implement in practice
> [!note]
> the above approach was not working because android was not able to see the file storage 
> of termux, so even if I clone my repo 
> obsidian installed on android won't be able to work with it.

*2025-02-27*
My life is fucked, and that asshole Shreyas is here, to dance on my fucking grave
Oh the motherfucking stress he gives me,
this motherfucker makes my life a living hell.

<p style="color: blue;">Day - 1</p>
Day - 1

## 20th July 2024

### Day - 2

I have woke up at 08:00 am, and have solved some DSA and CP questions.
Now I don't know what to do. I am feeling very indecisive about what
to do. Perhaps I should watch one video of Dr. K.

Since today is a new day, and I am starting this kind of thing from
scratch, I don't really have anything important in my mind.
But I will make some kind of list nonetheless:

- [x] At 06:00 pm, go for some running
- [x] At 08:00 pm, set an alarm for Leetcode contest

I think this much is enough for now. I will make some other changes if needed.

# Day - 3

- Date: 22/06/2024

I haved learnt something new about my brain today

- everything my brain feels, it has been evolved to
  feel so
- the anxiety that I feel does also have a reason, rather than
  ignoring it or trying to avoid my emotion( i.e. anxiety in this case)
  maybe I should try to get under the reason of why am I feeling so
- anxiety I think is a **anticipation mechanism**, through which we
  try to foresee things, and how to make them better in the future
- everything can be made in proper manner, if we split the sitatution
  in suitable easier term to understand
- anytime we have anxious thoughts, our anxious thoughts are always
  about the future
- anything that hurts us physically or mentally, there is a possibillity that our mind can become anxious due to anticipation of that outcome in the future
- and the degree of influence of that hurt or anxiety would depend on the gap between the present circumstance and the future time
- also it depends on the degree of hurt or effect that thing which is missing or goes wrong in the future also affects us
## How to I normally try to deal with anxiety
- Whenever the feeling of anxiety decides to get worse, I try to escape from it from distracting my mind in the present
    1. Some of the ways are I try to watch a some low-effort and entertaining albeit distacting video on youtube many a times the content of the video is not that important to me, as much as keeping my mind away from the anxious thoughts are important
    2. Other times I think of going to other people talk useless shit with them
    3. And there are other ways perhaps I will elaborate about them in the future when I become more aware of the behavior



## Day - 3
- Date - 23/07/2024
Goals for today
- [ ] Read 1 chapter of Golang programming language book
- [ ] Read 1 hour on OOPS
- [ ] Read 1 hour on OS
- [ ] Read DSA theory 1 hour from GFG

## Day - 4
**Date - 30/07/2024**
//
Nothing is really changing, I am doing the same thing everyday with so sign of improvement.
I dont know how to get out of this loop. I started meditation some days ago, but for now
I have stopped practicing it. Who am I waiting for??
I am very very weak in problem solving, I strongly need practice, there are only two choices for
me, whether to be weak in problem solving, or be strong in it. 
I choose the latter.

Some






## Day 5
-  Date 08/08/2024

Human beings have a primal brain, whenever there is any difficult situation
they are facing there parasympathetic nervous system takes over. 
They start seeing things in black & white and they start thinking in black & white.

- Today's Complany Applications
1. DevOps Intern(https://jobs.bureau.id/?ashby_jid=fc951ad0-bdd1-4b36-b354-e3f8964aabda&utm_source=0v66G4vzkn)
  They are looking for a six-months internship in Banglore.
  Must prepare for this one seriously

## Day 6
- Date 20/08/2024
- Today's Company Applications
1. Software Engineer - node/Python
Hyderabad, Telangana (https://dhan.freshteam.com/jobs/_iz9XKgk3VFU/software-engineer-node-python?ft_source=1000108832&ft_medium=1000102594)
2. Your application was sent to Yext!

## Day 7 
This is a new begining for me,as I have stopped wasting time on youtube and I am going to try fully to 
control my other addictions, and I am going to practice meditation whenever I get some break.

### Problems Done
1. DFS shortest path problem( could've improved time complexity by using Dijsktra or Bellman Ford)
2. Maximum Difference (GFG POTD)(made used of monotonically increases stack from left and right hand side)
3. https://neetcode.io/problems/count-connected-components (I finally solved this question from scratch without looking)
4. 

  #   Day 1
2024-10-06

## Problems done today
1. "424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement /leetcode"

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string 
and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation 
at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get 
after performing the above operations.

So here is my approach, writing as simpler as I can

```
create a hashmap to store frequency of each letter
start = 0, end = 0
store frequency of substring from start to end
```

#  Day 2
2024-10-07
01:04

So call out my name.

## Problems done today
2. Min-Stack Problem
Given a class MinStack, I have to design it to 
perform 4 operations in constant time complexity
    - push() 
    - pop()
    - top()
    - getMin() returns the min element in constant time

    * Approach One was to design the stack to hold pairs first element would the current element,
    and the second element would the minimum element encountered so far
    * Leetcode himself was not able to provide any more optimal approach
    * But people were telling me that it can be done using some mathematics(hashing)
    with a single element and single stack i.e. not storing pairs in the stack

3. Daily Temperatures
I maintained a monotonically decreasing stack here, since for a 
given value, I needed to get the next higher value after it
so by maintaining a monoto. decreasing stack I am storing all the
small values, and if I see a greater value after these values
I would be able to answer the question using the position of this
higher value.

**For now I am coding the listening to coldplay.** 





Since I am a programmer, I am doing coding and stuff for the majority of my life so 
it wouldn't be a surprise if my journal would contain stuff which I have learn in 
programming or some details of my work-life
Let me say this I have stopped caring about the work-life balance now
And my journal would be convoluted with diverse stuffs from this point on.
## 2025-03-31
#### Living the life in duality
I am going to live my life in duality and confusion, whatever things or thoughprocess I have
can be changed anytime
But I will always be a man of action, whatever happens I won't hestitate in taking action
I won't think about whether that action could a optimal action, good action or a action which will
harm me in future.


#### Studying of dev-container cli
I am going to do some practice with this tool for now
I tried unsuccessfully making the platform-dev container work, but it still is being a pain in the ass.

#### Restarting my interview preparation journey
- I am going to start solving the DSA problems once
- Will apply to 2 companies everyday
- The first topic which I am weak at and should focus on is recursion
- So I am going to solve CodeWithMik recursion (popular interview problems) playlist

## 2025-04-06
### Some understanding of the keus platform I've gained by deeper reading of the platform code
- that postman-remote-server.sh script starts after the we are able to successfully call the get the GetNodeConfig handler using moleculer gaterway
```js
checkNodeConfig() {
    NODE_CONFIG=$(curl --silent http://localhost:3000/keus/v1/node_configuration/GetNodeConfig)
    NODE_ID=$(jq -r '.nodeConfig.nodeId' <<< "$NODE_CONFIG")
    SITE_ID=$(jq -r '.nodeConfig.siteInfo.siteId' <<< "$NODE_CONFIG")

    echo $SITE_ID $NODE_ID $NODE_CONFIG
}
```
 This is the end

## 2025-07-31
It has been almost 2 months since I did any writing, I am just busy with this job at Keus, and also walking 8 kilometers everyday makes me very tired.

## 2025-10-27
Today after such a long time I am able to apply to a job opening
1. https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/software-engineering-new-grad/7176975/apply?gh_src=73vnei granted it was for freshers and I am working professional, but I just want to get out of my current company.
Some observations
I think the companies that are having 500-1000 people are the best and then a normal distribution follows
