Dear Hiring Team at Stripe,

I’m Vivek Upadhyay, Computer Science graduate from IIITM Gwalior, passionate about building reliable, scalable systems that make a real-world impact. Stripe’s mission to “increase the GDP of the internet” deeply resonates with me—I’ve always been driven by the idea of building infrastructure that empowers others to create.

In my role at **Keus Automation**, I designed a multi-node architecture enabling hubs to communicate over distributed NATS connections and developed an automation service now in production. I am also working on many user facing services like buil

Beyond professional experience, I actively explore systems design and open-source projects in Golang, Kubernetes, and machine learning, continuously striving to build things that scale gracefully and fail safely.

At Stripe, I’m eager to work alongside engineers who value rigor, reliability, and community impact—helping shape the backbone of the internet’s financial infrastructure while growing as a thoughtful builder and teammate.

Sincerely,  
**Vivek Upadhyay**
