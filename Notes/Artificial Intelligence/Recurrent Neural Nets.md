# Sequence Modeling: Recurrent and Recursive Nets

### What is it?
**Sequence modeling** involves techniques designed to handle data that is ordered in sequences, such as time series, text, or speech.

#### Key Architectures
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
  - **Description**: Networks with loops that maintain a hidden state capturing previous inputs.
  - **Use Cases**: Language modeling, time series prediction.

- **Recursive Neural Networks**
  - **Description**: Networks designed to process data with a tree-like structure.
  - **Use Cases**: Parsing natural language sentences.

### Where Did It Come From?
| Year | Development                             | Key Contribution                                       |
|------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1980s| RNN Concept                            | Basic model for sequential data.                      |
| 1990s| Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)   | Training method for RNNs.                            |
| 1997 | Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)         | Addressed vanishing gradient problem.                  |
| 2010s| Recursive Networks                      | Model for structured data, particularly in NLP.      |

### How Do We Use It?
### [[How are RNN made from ANN]]
#### Steps to Implement RNNs and Recursive Networks

1. **Model Selection**
   - Choose RNN for sequential data.
   - Choose Recursive Networks for hierarchical structures.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - **RNN**: Pad sequences for uniform length.
   - **Recursive**: Structure data into trees.

3. **Training**
   - Use training data to optimize weights with:
     - RNN: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).
     - Recursive: Recursive backpropagation.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Assess performance using metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - Mean Squared Error

5. **Deployment**
   - Integrate into applications for real-time or batch processing.

### Notes and Reminders
- **NOTE**: RNNs are particularly effective for tasks requiring context from previous data.
- **TODO**: Review applications of LSTM and GRU for improved performance over standard RNNs.
- **TIP**: When training RNNs, consider techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
