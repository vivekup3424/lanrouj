	3. Inception Net
		1. since the size of filters keep on changing
		2. we are finding out features at multiple scales
		3. ![[Pasted image 20241111163412.png]]
		4. The wider the better, it means we are applying more number of feature detection=>more number of convolution operations, and then we pool them up
		5. somethimes we have 1x1 kernel convolution=> we are applying linear transformation
		6. but why do we apply 1x1
