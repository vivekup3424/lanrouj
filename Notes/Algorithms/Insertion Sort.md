**Insertion sort** is a simple [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm "Sorting algorithm") that builds the final [sorted array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorted_array "Sorted array") (or list) one item at a time [by comparisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort "Comparison sort"). It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort "Quicksort"), [heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort "Heapsort"), or [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort "Merge sort"). However, insertion sort provides several advantages:

- Simple implementation: [Jon Bentley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley_\(computer_scientist\) "Jon Bentley (computer scientist)") shows a version that is three lines in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_\(programming_language\) "C (programming language)")-like pseudo-code, and five lines when [optimized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization "Program optimization").[[Notes/KEUS/1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort#cite_note-pearls-1)
- Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic (i.e., [O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation")(_n_2)) sorting algorithms
- More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic algorithms such as [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort "Selection sort") or [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort "Bubble sort")
- [Adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort "Adaptive sort"), i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity "Time complexity") is [O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation")(_kn_) when each element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position
- [Stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_sort "Stable sort"); i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
- [In-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm "In-place algorithm"); i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
- [Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm "Online algorithm"); i.e., can sort a list as it receives it

When people manually sort cards in a [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge "Contract bridge") hand, most use a method that is similar to insertion sort
