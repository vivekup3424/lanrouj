****Merge sort**** is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It follows the [****divide-and-conquer****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-divide-and-conquer-algorithm-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/) approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves, recursively sorting the two halves and finally merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.
```c
void mergeSort(int arr[], int l, int r){
if(l==r){
	return;
}
}
```
