When `i` reaches 31, `1 << 31` results in `-2147483648`. This is because youâ€™re working with a 32-bit signed integer, where the highest bit (bit 31) is the sign bit.

### Explanation

In a 32-bit signed integer, shifting `1` to the 31st position (i.e., `1 << 31`) sets the sign bit to `1`, which represents a negative value in two's complement form. The value `1 << 31` becomes `-2147483648` in decimal, which is why you see a negative number in the output.
