## Real time examples of stack:

Stacks are used in various real-world scenarios where a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure is required. Here are some examples of real-time applications of stacks:

**Function call stack***: When a function is called in a program, the return address and all the function parameters are pushed onto the function call stack. The stack allows the function to execute and return to the caller function in the reverse order in which they were called.

****Undo/Redo operations:**** In many applications, such as text editors, image editors, or web browsers, the undo and redo functionalities are implemented using a stack. Every time an action is performed, it is pushed onto the stack. When the user wants to undo the last action, the top element of the stack is popped and the action is reversed.

****Browser history:**** Web browsers use stacks to keep track of the pages visited by the user. Every time a new page is visited, its URL is pushed onto the stack. When the user clicks the “Back” button, the last visited URL is popped from the stack and the user is directed to the previous page.

****Expression evaluation****: Stacks are used in compilers and interpreters to evaluate expressions. When an expression is parsed, it is converted into postfix notation and pushed onto a stack. The postfix expression is then evaluated using the stack.

****Call stack in recursion:**** When a recursive function is called, its call is pushed onto the stack. The function executes and calls itself, and each subsequent call is pushed onto the stack. When the recursion ends, the stack is popped, and the program returns to the previous function call.
### Stack is a data structure where we can add elements in a fixed ordered format, and then remove form it in a Last-in First Out Manner
