# Monte-Carlo Simulation
1. Elements
	1. Population - whole array of possibilities
	2. Samples - sampled subet of possibilities

## Random Numbers
![[Pasted image 20241119182224.png]]
### Types of Random Numbers:-
1. Real Random Numbers
	1. Uses a physical source of randomness
	2. ![[Pasted image 20241119182659.png]]
2. Pseudo Random Numbers
	1. deterministic sequences that passes tests of randomness
	2. Since we know the algorithms, hence they can be predictable and deterministic
	3. If we know the seed number, we would be able to replicate the random number
	4. 
### Properties for random numbers :-
1. . Uniformity (uniform distribution)
	1. The number should be uniformly distributed on a range
	2. ![[Pasted image 20241119183958.png]]

2. Independent 
	1. Numbers generated should have no correlation with each other.
3. Unpredectibility 
### Additional properties of pseudo-randoms
4. Cycle Length
	1. It should take long before numbers start to repeat
5. Speed of PRNGs should be fast.
6. PRNGs should be require a lot of storage.
