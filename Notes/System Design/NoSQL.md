## **NoSQL Simplified Explanation**

NoSQL databases are a type of database designed to handle different kinds of data and workloads that traditional databases (like those using SQL) may struggle with. Unlike traditional databases, NoSQL databases don't always use SQL, the standard query language.
[[CAP Theorem]] tells us about the usecases of different NoSQL databases and on which scope they operate upon.
## **Key Points:**

1. **What Does NoSQL Mean?**  
    NoSQL stands for **"Not Only SQL"**, meaning it can work with or without SQL. It shows that databases today are flexible and can use various approaches, not just the traditional way of organizing data in rows and tables.
    
2. **Different Types of NoSQL Databases**:
	NoSQL databases are a class of database management systems designed to handle a variety of data models that differ from traditional relational databases. These databases are optimized for high performance, scalability, and flexibility, often trading off some features of relational databases (like strong consistency or complex querying).

### Summary

NoSQL databases provide diverse tools for handling modern application needs, each optimized for specific use cases. Choosing the right database involves understanding your application's requirements (e.g., scalability, consistency, query complexity) and aligning them with the strengths of these databases.

In short, NoSQL databases are modern, flexible tools for handling data in ways that go beyond the traditional rows-and-columns structure.
