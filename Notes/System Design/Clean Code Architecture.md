## Explanation of Platform Agent Architecture
The **Clean Architecture** design pattern helps in building maintainable, scalable, and testable software by separating concerns into distinct layers. This architecture enforces dependency rules, ensuring that high-level business logic is not affected by low-level implementation details like databases or external services. Below is a breakdown of the key layers and their responsibilities.

---

## **1. Domain Layer**

**(Core Business Logic - Independent of Frameworks & External Dependencies)**

The **Domain Layer** contains the most critical part of the applicationâ€”the business rules. It is completely independent of external systems like databases, frameworks, and UI, making it the most reusable and stable layer.

### Components:

- **Entities:** Represent core business objects and define their properties and behavior.
- **Repositories (Interfaces):** Define abstract data access operations without specifying implementations.
- **Use-Cases:** Contain application-specific business rules, executing core functionalities by interacting with repositories and entities.

---

## **2. Application (Presentation) Layer**

**(Handles API & UI Interaction - Maps Use Cases to Controllers)**

This layer acts as a bridge between the domain layer and external clients like REST APIs, WebSockets, or UI components. It mainly consists of controllers that process client requests, apply business rules (via use-cases), and return responses.

### Components:

- **App.ts:** The entry point for the application.
- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP/WebSocket requests and invoke appropriate use-cases.

---

## **3. Infrastructure Layer**

**(Implements External Services & Data Management)**

The **Infrastructure Layer** provides implementations for external dependencies like databases, message brokers, API gateways, and third-party services. It serves as a supporting layer for the domain logic, ensuring flexibility and modularity.

### Components:

- **Adapters:** Implement communication interfaces such as HTTP, WebSockets, and NATS messaging.
- **Event Listeners:** React to incoming events from external sources.
- **Mappers:** Convert between domain models and external data representations.
- **Managers:** Handle low-level implementations for external clients like MongoDB and NATS.
- **Data Layer:**
    - **Models:** Define flexible data structures for databases, RPC communication, etc.
    - **Repository Implementations:** Concrete implementations of repository interfaces.
    - **Sources:** Categorize data origins (local, remote, etc.).

---

## **4. Dependency Injection (DI) Module**

**(Manages Object Creation & Dependency Wiring)**

The **DI Module** is responsible for configuring and managing dependencies in the system. It ensures that components follow the **Inversion of Control (IoC)** principle, allowing for better testability and modularity.

### Components:

- **Factories:** Create instances of repositories and use-cases.
- **Containers:** Manage different DI configurations for various layers (Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation).
- **Index.ts:** Centralized dependency configuration and container export.

---

## **5. Deployments**

**(Environment Configurations & Deployment Settings)**

The **Deployments Layer** contains configuration files and scripts for different deployment environments (development, production, etc.), ensuring smooth deployment and scalability.

### Components:

- **Deployment Configurations:** Stores settings and environment variables for different environments.
- **Dev/Prod Environments:** Define different configurations for development and production.

---

## **Key Benefits of This Architecture**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a clear responsibility.
- **Scalability:** New features can be added without affecting core business logic.
- **Testability:** Business logic can be tested independently from infrastructure concerns.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to swap external dependencies (e.g., databases, messaging systems) without affecting the core domain.

This architecture provides a structured, maintainable, and future-proof design, ensuring long-term stability for your application. ðŸš€
