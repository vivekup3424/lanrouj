Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are typically categorized into **three main types** based on the nature of the problem they solve:

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to make the process flexible and reusable.

#### **Key Patterns:**

1. **Singleton**
    
    - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
    - **Use Case:** Database connection pools or configuration managers.
    - **Example (Python):**
        
        ```python
        class Singleton:
            _instance = None
            def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
                if not cls._instance:
                    cls._instance = super().__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
                return cls._instance
        ```
        
2. [[Factory Method]]
    
    - Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.
    - **Use Case:** When the exact type of object isn't known until runtime.
    - **Example (Python):**
        
        ```python
        class ShapeFactory:
            def create_shape(self, shape_type):
                if shape_type == "circle":
                    return Circle()
                elif shape_type == "square":
                    return Square()
        ```
        
3. **Abstract Factory**
    
    - Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    - **Use Case:** GUI frameworks where you need Windows or macOS-specific widgets.
4. **Builder**
    
    - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
    - **Use Case:** Construct objects step-by-step (e.g., assembling a car with optional features).
5. **Prototype**
    
    - Creates new objects by copying existing ones.
    - **Use Case:** When creating objects is costly or complex, and cloning is more efficient.

### **How to Start Learning Design Patterns**

1. **Learn the Problems First:**
    
    - Understand the problems these patterns solve before diving into the implementations.
    - Example: Read about why decoupling (e.g., Adapter, Bridge) or reusability (e.g., Singleton, Factory) is important.
2. **Pick a Few Patterns:**
    
    - Start with **Strategy**, **Observer**, **Singleton**, and **Factory**, as they are commonly used and easy to grasp.
3. **Implement in Practice:**
    
    - Apply these patterns to small projects, like a to-do app, a game, or an e-commerce system.
4. **Explore Frameworks:**
    
    - Many frameworks/libraries use patterns internally (e.g., Django uses Template and Observer patterns).
