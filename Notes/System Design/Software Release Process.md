The release process you've described is a structured approach to managing the stages of software development and deployment. It ensures that code changes are tested and validated at different stages before being released to users in a stable version. Here’s how it works with a breakdown of the different stages (or channels):

### 1. **Pull Requests to Main Branch**

- **What happens**: Developers create "pull requests" (PRs) to propose changes to the codebase. Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, it gets merged into the **main** branch.
- **Example**: Suppose a developer adds a new feature to the application. They create a pull request to merge their feature branch into the `main` branch after completing the work. Once merged, this code is considered part of the ongoing project.

### 2. **Build is Pushed to Dev Stage**

- **What happens**: After the code is merged into the main branch, an automatic build is triggered (this could be through a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline). The new build is deployed to the **dev stage**, which is an environment for developers and testers to validate the recent changes.
- **Example**: After the feature is merged, the system automatically compiles the code and runs unit tests to ensure there are no immediate errors. This build is deployed to the **development environment** (dev stage) where it can be tested by developers or QA testers.

### 3. **Releases are Published**

- **What happens**: After validating the changes in the dev environment, the build might be ready for a more public stage. At this point, a release is formally published, usually indicating the build is feature-complete and stable enough for broader testing.
- **Example**: A team may release a version of the application to a group of users for initial feedback. These users are likely those who are involved in the testing or those who opt into early-stage testing.

### 4. **Build is Pushed to Beta Stage**

- **What happens**: After the release is published, the build is pushed to the **beta stage**. The beta environment typically has more comprehensive testing, often with real users or a wider audience (e.g., beta testers). At this point, feedback from this stage is gathered for any final improvements or bug fixes.
- **Example**: Now that the feature is working in the dev environment, it is made available to a select group of beta users, who will test it in real-world conditions. These users might notice bugs or performance issues that weren’t found during earlier testing.

### 5. **The `stable.json` File is Updated**

- **What happens**: A file, typically named `stable.json`, might be used to track the current stable version of the application. This file is updated when a build has passed all tests in the beta stage and is considered ready for production.
- **Example**: After resolving any bugs discovered during beta testing, the `stable.json` file is updated to indicate that the beta build is now the new stable version. This signals that the software is ready for production use.

### 6. **Build Pushed to Stable Channel**

- **What happens**: After final approval from the beta stage, the build is pushed to the **stable channel**, which is the environment that end users will access. This version is considered stable and is the one that users will receive when they download or update the application.
- **Example**: After the feedback from the beta testing phase, the same build is deployed to the production environment (stable channel). This is the version available to all users of the application.

### Summary Example:

Let’s assume you are working on a new version of a mobile app:

- **Stage 1**: The developers merge a new feature (like a dark mode toggle) into the `main` branch.
- **Stage 2**: A build is automatically triggered and pushed to the **dev stage** where the development team can test if the feature works as expected.
- **Stage 3**: The app is published as a "release" to a group of testers, who give feedback on the new feature.
- **Stage 4**: The feature is pushed to the **beta stage** for broader testing with more users to check for bugs in real-world usage.
- **Stage 5**: After bug fixes and improvements, the `stable.json` file is updated to indicate the new version.
- **Stage 6**: The final version, now confirmed as stable, is deployed to the **stable channel**, making it available to all users for download and use.

This process helps maintain a high level of quality control by ensuring that each release is well-tested in multiple stages before it reaches the end users.
