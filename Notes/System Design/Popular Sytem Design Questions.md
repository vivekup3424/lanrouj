### **System Design Questions with Brief Answers :**

1. **Design a URL shortening service like Bitly.**  
    Use a hash function to generate short codes and store the mapping in a database for fast redirection.
    
2. **Design a file storage system like Google Drive.**  
    Use cloud storage for files and a relational database for metadata, with access control and versioning.
    
3. **Design a cache system (e.g., LRU cache).**  
    Use a hash map and doubly linked list to implement the LRU eviction policy.
    
4. **Design a simple social media platform (e.g., Instagram).**  
    Store user data in a NoSQL database, with image storage in the cloud and real-time notifications via WebSockets.
    
5. **Design an e-commerce checkout system.**  
    Use a transactional system with a relational database for orders, payment gateway integration, and inventory management.
    
6. **Design a real-time messaging system (e.g., WhatsApp).**  
    Use WebSockets for real-time communication and store messages in a distributed database.
    
7. **Design a video streaming service (e.g., YouTube).**  
    Store videos in cloud storage, use CDN for content delivery, and relational databases for user interactions.
    
8. **Design a content delivery network (CDN).**  
    Use globally distributed edge servers to cache content, reducing latency, and routing requests via DNS.
    
9. **Design a recommendation engine (e.g., Netflix recommendations).**  
    Use collaborative or content-based filtering with a NoSQL database to store user behavior and content metadata.
    
10. **Design a rate limiter system.**  
    Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms with Redis to limit requests and prevent abuse.
    
11. **Design a real-time analytics system (e.g., web traffic monitoring).**  
    Use stream processing frameworks like Kafka and Spark, and store data in time-series databases.
    
12. **Design a microservices architecture for a large application.**  
    Use REST APIs for communication, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration.
    
13. **Design a distributed job scheduler.**  
    Use a distributed queue (e.g., RabbitMQ), with worker nodes to process tasks concurrently.
    
14. **Design a highly available database system.**  
    Use replication, sharding, and consistent hashing to ensure fault tolerance and scalability.
    
15. **Design a search engine.**  
    Use an inverted index to map keywords to documents and employ ranking algorithms like PageRank.
    
16. **Design an online ticket booking system (e.g., for movies, flights).**  
    Use a relational database for seat reservations, with a real-time system for concurrency control.
    
17. **Design a payment gateway system.**  
    Use encryption for security, integrate with external payment providers, and implement fraud detection.
    
18. **Design a location-based service (e.g., Uber).**  
    Use real-time GPS data and geospatial indexing for ride dispatching and tracking.
    
19. **Design a real-time collaboration platform (e.g., Google Docs).**  
    Use WebSockets for live editing, CRDTs for conflict-free concurrent updates, and distributed storage.
    
20. **Design a video conferencing system (e.g., Zoom).**  
    Use WebRTC for peer-to-peer video/audio streaming and TURN/STUN servers for NAT traversal.
    
21. **Design a blogging platform.**  
    Use a NoSQL database for posts, tags, and comments, with caching for high-traffic content.
    
22. **Design a notification system.**  
    Use push notifications with a message queue to ensure scalability and delivery reliability.
    
23. **Design a URL redirection service (e.g., 301 redirect).**  
    Store original URLs and their redirection URLs in a key-value store and redirect based on the key.
    
24. **Design a voting system (e.g., elections).**  
    Use a relational database for votes, implement safeguards against duplicate voting, and ensure privacy.
    
25. **Design a file sharing service.**  
    Store files in cloud storage, use a database for user and permission management, and implement file versioning.
    
26. **Design a job queue system (e.g., for background tasks).**  
    Use a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka to manage queues, with workers to process jobs.
    
27. **Design a system for sending emails.**  
    Use an SMTP server to send emails, with a database for managing email queues and delivery logs.
    
28. **Design a cloud-based analytics dashboard.**  
    Use a distributed data storage system and a dashboard frontend that queries real-time analytics data.
    
29. **Design a file compression service.**  
    Use compression algorithms (e.g., gzip) to reduce file size and store compressed files in cloud storage.
    
30. **Design a monitoring system for server health.**  
    Use a distributed system to collect metrics, store them in a time-series database, and use alerts based on thresholds.
