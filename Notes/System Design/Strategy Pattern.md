The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern used in system design to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the behavior of a class to be selected at runtime, promoting flexibility and adherence to key principles like **Open-Closed Principle** (open for extension, closed for modification) and **Single Responsibility Principle**.

### Key Concepts

1. **Strategy Interface**: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: Implement different variations of the algorithm.
3. **Context Class**: Maintains a reference to a `Strategy` object and delegates behavior to it.

---

### When to Use the Strategy Pattern

- You need different variants of an algorithm.
- You want to avoid using conditional statements (e.g., `if-else` or `switch-case`) to select an algorithm.
- The behavior of a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.

### Example: Payment Processing System

Imagine designing a system to process payments using various payment methods (credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency, etc.).

1. **Strategy Interface**

```python
class PaymentStrategy:
    def pay(self, amount):
        pass
```

2. **Concrete Strategies**

```python
class CreditCardPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def __init__(self, card_number):
        self.card_number = card_number

    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid {amount} using Credit Card {self.card_number}")

class PayPalPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email

    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid {amount} using PayPal account {self.email}")

class CryptoPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def __init__(self, wallet_address):
        self.wallet_address = wallet_address

    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid {amount} using Cryptocurrency wallet {self.wallet_address}")
```

3. **Context Class**

```python
class PaymentContext:
    def __init__(self, strategy: PaymentStrategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def set_strategy(self, strategy: PaymentStrategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def execute_payment(self, amount):
        self.strategy.pay(amount)
```

4. **Client Code**

```python
# Example usage
context = PaymentContext(CreditCardPayment("1234-5678-9876-5432"))
context.execute_payment(100)

context.set_strategy(PayPalPayment("user@example.com"))
context.execute_payment(200)

context.set_strategy(CryptoPayment("1A2b3C4D5e"))
context.execute_payment(300)
```

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern

1. **Open-Closed Principle**: Adding new algorithms doesn’t require modifying existing code.
2. **Flexibility**: Algorithms can be swapped easily at runtime.
3. **Testing and Maintenance**: Isolated algorithms make unit testing and debugging easier.

---

### Drawbacks

1. **Increased Complexity**: Introducing multiple strategy classes increases the number of components.
2. **Potential Overhead**: If the strategies are simple, this pattern may be overkill.

### UML Diagram

Here’s a basic UML representation of the Strategy Pattern:

```
+-----------------+
| PaymentStrategy |<---------------------------+
+-----------------+                            |
| + pay(amount)   |                            |
+-----------------+                            |
          ^                                    |
          |                                    |
+-------------------+       +------------------+
| CreditCardPayment |       | PayPalPayment    |
+-------------------+       +------------------+
| + pay(amount)     |       | + pay(amount)    |
+-------------------+       +------------------+

            +--------------------+
            | PaymentContext     |
            +--------------------+
            | - strategy         |
            | + set_strategy()   |
            | + execute_payment()|
            +--------------------+
```
