The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** are related principles within the **SOLID** framework, and they share some similarities in their focus on **modularity**, **separation of concerns**, and **maintainability**. Here's a detailed comparison:

### **Similarities between SRP and ISP**

1. **Both Promote Separation of Concerns**
    
    - **SRP:** Ensures that a class or module has only one reason to change by assigning it a single, clear responsibility.
    - **ISP:** Ensures that clients only depend on the specific methods they need by splitting large, generalized interfaces into smaller, more focused ones.  
        In both cases, the aim is to reduce unnecessary coupling and dependencies.
2. **Encourage Modularity**
    
    - Both principles advocate breaking down complex systems into smaller, well-defined parts that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
    - **SRP** focuses on modularity within classes, while **ISP** focuses on modularity within interfaces.
3. **Improve Maintainability**
    
    - By adhering to SRP, changes to one responsibility of a class do not affect unrelated functionalities.
    - By adhering to ISP, changes to one interface or method do not force unrelated clients to change.  
        Both principles lead to code that is easier to update and debug.
4. **Reduce Impact of Changes**
    
    - **SRP:** Localizes the impact of changes by ensuring each class deals with only one aspect of the program.
    - **ISP:** Reduces the ripple effect of changes by allowing clients to depend only on the methods they need.  
        This minimizes the risk of breaking unrelated parts of the system.

### **Differences between SRP and ISP**

|**Aspect**|**SRP**|**ISP**|
|---|---|---|
|**Focus**|Responsibility of a single **class or module**.|Segmentation of **interfaces** to meet specific client needs.|
|**Primary Goal**|Avoid mixing multiple responsibilities in a single class.|Avoid forcing clients to depend on methods they donâ€™t use.|
|**Scope**|Concerned with **internal cohesion** of classes.|Concerned with the **relationship between clients and interfaces**.|
|**Typical Smell**|Classes with too many responsibilities or reasons to change.|Interfaces with too many methods or unused dependencies.|
|**Solution Approach**|Split classes into smaller ones, each with a distinct responsibility.|Split large interfaces into smaller ones, each tailored to specific client requirements.|

### **Practical Example Combining SRP and ISP**

Imagine designing a system for a multi-function device (printer, scanner, fax machine).

#### **Before Applying SRP and ISP:**

```python
class MultiFunctionDevice:
    def print(self, document):
        pass

    def scan(self, document):
        pass

    def fax(self, document):
        pass
```

**Issues:**

- **SRP Violation:** The `MultiFunctionDevice` class handles multiple responsibilities (printing, scanning, faxing).
- **ISP Violation:** A client that only needs scanning is forced to depend on `print` and `fax`.

#### **After Applying SRP and ISP:**

- **SRP:** Split responsibilities into separate classes for printing, scanning, and faxing.
- **ISP:** Define smaller interfaces tailored to each responsibility.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Printable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def print(self, document):
        pass

class Scannable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def scan(self, document):
        pass

class Faxable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def fax(self, document):
        pass

class Printer(Printable):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")

class Scanner(Scannable):
    def scan(self, document):
        print(f"Scanning: {document}")

class FaxMachine(Faxable):
    def fax(self, document):
        print(f"Faxing: {document}")
```

**Benefits:**

- **SRP:** Each class now has a single responsibility (printing, scanning, or faxing).
- **ISP:** Clients only depend on the specific functionality they require.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **SRP** focuses on ensuring that **classes/modules** have only one responsibility.
- **ISP** ensures that **interfaces** are small and focused, providing only what clients need.
- Both principles work together to promote modular, maintainable, and decoupled systems.
