Here are detailed descriptions of several common process synchronization problems, including their definitions, causes, solutions (with C++ examples), and real-world applications.

### 1. **Producer-Consumer (Bounded Buffer) Problem**

#### What is it?
The Producer-Consumer problem involves two types of processes: the producer, which generates data and adds it to a shared buffer, and the consumer, which consumes data from the buffer. The buffer has a fixed size (bounded buffer), so the producer must wait if the buffer is full, and the consumer must wait if the buffer is empty.
Can be solved with [[Peterson's Solution]]

#### Why does it exist?
The problem arises due to the need for synchronization when multiple processes or threads share a common resource (buffer). Without synchronization, race conditions can occur, leading to inconsistent or incorrect data processing.

#### How to solve this problem (C++ example using mutex and condition variables):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

std::queue<int> buffer;
const unsigned int maxBufferSize = 10;

std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cvProducer, cvConsumer;

void producer(int id) {
    int data = 0;
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        cvProducer.wait(lock, [] { return buffer.size() < maxBufferSize; });
        buffer.push(data++);
        std::cout << "Producer " << id << " produced: " << data << std::endl;
        cvConsumer.notify_all();
    }
}

void consumer(int id) {
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        cvConsumer.wait(lock, [] { return !buffer.empty(); });
        int data = buffer.front();
        buffer.pop();
        std::cout << "Consumer " << id << " consumed: " << data << std::endl;
        cvProducer.notify_all();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread producers[2], consumers[2];

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        producers[i] = std::thread(producer, i);
        consumers[i] = std::thread(consumer, i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        producers[i].join();
        consumers[i].join();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Where can we encounter them in the real world?
- **Real-world example**: The producer-consumer problem is encountered in data pipelines where a producer generates data (e.g., sensor data, video frames) and the consumer processes this data (e.g., filtering, storing).
- **Operating Systems**: I/O buffering where a process produces data (e.g., file writing) and another process consumes it (e.g., reading from a file).

### 2. **Readers-Writers Problem**

#### What is it?
The Readers-Writers problem involves processes that either read or write a shared resource (e.g., a database). Multiple readers can read the resource simultaneously, but if a writer is writing to the resource, no other readers or writers should access it.

#### Why does it exist?
It exists because reading does not alter the state of the shared resource, so multiple readers can work concurrently, but writing must be done exclusively to prevent data corruption or inconsistency.

#### How to solve this problem (C++ example using reader-writer locks):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <shared_mutex>

std::shared_mutex rwLock;
int sharedData = 0;

void reader(int id) {
    while (true) {
        std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(rwLock);
        std::cout << "Reader " << id << " reads: " << sharedData << std::endl;
    }
}

void writer(int id) {
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(rwLock);
        sharedData++;
        std::cout << "Writer " << id << " writes: " << sharedData << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread readers[5], writers[2];

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        readers[i] = std::thread(reader, i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        writers[i] = std::thread(writer, i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        readers[i].join();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        writers[i].join();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Where can we encounter them in the real world?
- **Real-world example**: Databases where multiple users can read data concurrently but need exclusive access when modifying data.
- **Operating Systems**: Filesystems allowing multiple processes to read from a file, but exclusive access is required when writing to the file.

### 3. **Dining Philosophers Problem**

#### What is it?
The Dining Philosophers problem involves `n` philosophers sitting around a table with `n` chopsticks. Each philosopher needs two chopsticks to eat, but there is only one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. They must alternate between thinking and eating.

#### Why does it exist?
It demonstrates the challenge of allocating resources (chopsticks) between multiple processes (philosophers) without causing deadlock or resource starvation, especially when the number of resources is limited.

#### How to solve this problem (C++ example using mutex):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <vector>

const int numPhilosophers = 5;
std::mutex chopsticks[numPhilosophers];

void philosopher(int id) {
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "Philosopher " << id << " is thinking.\n";
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));

        std::lock(chopsticks[id], chopsticks[(id + 1) % numPhilosophers]);
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> leftLock(chopsticks[id], std::adopt_lock);
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> rightLock(chopsticks[(id + 1) % numPhilosophers], std::adopt_lock);

        std::cout << "Philosopher " << id << " is eating.\n";
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::thread> philosophers;

    for (int i = 0; i < numPhilosophers; ++i) {
        philosophers.emplace_back(philosopher, i);
    }

    for (auto& p : philosophers) {
        p.join();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Where can we encounter them in the real world?
- **Real-world example**: The Dining Philosophers problem models scenarios where multiple resources must be acquired before proceeding (e.g., acquiring locks on multiple database rows).
- **Operating Systems**: Resource allocation problems in multi-threaded applications or deadlock conditions when processes wait for multiple resources.

### 4. **Sleeping Barber Problem**

#### What is it?
The Sleeping Barber problem describes a barber who sleeps when there are no customers. When a customer arrives, they either wake the barber or sit in a waiting room (if space is available). If the waiting room is full, the customer leaves.

#### Why does it exist?
It models a situation where there are limited resources (chairs in the waiting room) and synchronization is needed between processes (customers) and a resource (barber).

#### How to solve this problem (C++ example using semaphore):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <queue>

std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cvBarber, cvCustomer;
std::queue<int> waitingRoom;
const int maxChairs = 3;
bool barberSleeping = true;

void barber() {
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        cvCustomer.wait(lock, [] { return !waitingRoom.empty(); });
        barberSleeping = false;
        int customer = waitingRoom.front();
        waitingRoom.pop();
        std::cout << "Barber is cutting hair for customer " << customer << std::endl;
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // cutting hair
        barberSleeping = true;
        cvBarber.notify_all();
    }
}

void customer(int id) {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (waitingRoom.size() < maxChairs) {
        waitingRoom.push(id);
        std::cout << "Customer " << id << " is waiting.\n";
        cvCustomer.notify_all();
        cvBarber.wait(lock, [] { return barberSleeping == true; });
    } else {
        std::cout << "Customer " << id << " left, no space.\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread barberThread(barber);

    std::thread customers[5];
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        customers[i] = std::thread(customer, i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        customers[i].join();
    }

    barberThread.join();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Where can we encounter them in the real world?
- **Real-world example**: Service systems with limited resources (e.g., call centers with limited

 operators or customer support desks).
- **Operating Systems**: Printer queues or shared hardware devices where processes need to wait for a resource to become available.
