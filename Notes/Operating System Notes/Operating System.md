# Operating System Basics

## What is an Operating System?
An **Operating System (OS)** is a software layer that manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. 
It acts as an **interface** between the user and the computer hardware, allowing for easier and more efficient management of resources.

## Key Functions of an Operating System:
1. **Process Management**
2. **Memory Management**: Manages system memory, including allocation/deallocation of memory space for programs, and managing **virtual memory**.
3. **File System Management**: Controls how data is stored, retrieved, and organized on storage devices. It handles file creation, deletion, and access permissions.
4. **Device Management**: Manages device communication via drivers, allowing the OS to interact with peripherals like **keyboards, mice, and printers**.
5. **Security and Access Control**: Provides user authentication, access control, and protection against unauthorized access to data and resources.

## Types of Operating Systems:
- **Batch Operating Systems**: Processes jobs in batches without user interaction.
- **Time-Sharing Operating Systems**: Allows multiple users to share system time and resources simultaneously.
- **Distributed Operating Systems**: Manages a group of independent computers and makes them appear as a single system.
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**: Provides real-time task management for critical applications, such as embedded systems.
