**Definition**: Peterson's solution is a classic algorithm used for achieving **mutual exclusion** between two processes or threads. It allows only one of the processes to enter the **critical section** at a time while the other one waits, thus avoiding **race conditions**.

### Key Concepts:
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Ensures that only one process can access a shared resource (critical section) at a time.
- **Progress**: If no process is in the critical section, the one that wants to enter should be allowed to do so.
- **Bounded Waiting**: Guarantees that a process wonâ€™t be delayed indefinitely before entering its critical section.

### Algorithm Explanation:
- **Two Variables**:
  - `flag[i]`: Indicates if process `i` wants to enter the critical section.
  - `turn`: Indicates whose turn it is to enter the critical section.
- **Process Workflow**:
  - Set `flag[i] = true` to indicate that process `i` wants to enter.
  - Set `turn = j` to give the other process the opportunity to enter the critical section.
  - Wait in a `while` loop until the other process is no longer interested (`flag[j] == false`) or it is not their turn (`turn != j`).
  - Enter the critical section.
  - Set `flag[i] = false` after exiting the critical section.

### C++ Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

std::vector<bool> flag(2, false); // Flags for the two threads
int turn = 0; // Whose turn it is

void process(int i) {
    int j = 1 - i; // The other process
    for (int k = 0; k < 5; ++k) { // Limited loop for demonstration
        // Entry Section
        flag[i] = true; // Indicate interest
        turn = j; // Give priority to the other process
        while (flag[j] && turn == j) {
            // Busy-wait: Wait if the other process is interested and it's their turn
        }

        // Critical Section
        std::cout << "Process " << i << " is in the critical section (Iteration " << k + 1 << ")\n";

        // Exit Section
        flag[i] = false; // Exit the critical section

        // Remainder Section (Outside critical section)
        std::cout << "Process " << i << " is in the remainder section\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(process, 0); // Start process 0
    std::thread t2(process, 1); // Start process 1

    t1.join(); // Wait for process 0 to finish
    t2.join(); // Wait for process 1 to finish

    return 0;
}
```

### Example Explanation:
- Two threads (representing processes `0` and `1`) use `flag` and `turn` for coordination.
- Each thread sets its `flag` to `true` when it wants to enter the critical section and sets `turn` to the other process.
- The `while` loop keeps the thread waiting if the other process also wants to enter the critical section and has priority.
- This solution ensures **mutual exclusion** and **prevents race conditions** as only one thread enters the critical section at a time.
