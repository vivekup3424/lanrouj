## Clevertap
**Conversion tracking in CleverTap** is the process of measuring how many users **completed a desired action** — such as a purchase, signup, or feature use — after interacting with a **campaign** or **event funnel**.

### Control Groups
In **CleverTap**, **Control Groups** are used to help you **measure the true effectiveness** of a campaign by comparing it against a **baseline group of users who do not receive the campaign**.

Let’s break this down from **first principles**.

When you run a campaign (push, email, in-app, etc.), users may convert for many reasons:

- They saw your campaign
    
- Or they were going to convert anyway (organic behavior)
    

To **truly measure the campaign's impact**, you need a **control group** — a group of users:

- Who match the campaign audience
    
- But **don’t receive the campaign**
    

This lets you answer:
