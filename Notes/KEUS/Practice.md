## Learning of today's research
1. Google was exposing conversational actions on "Actions on Google" console. there was a tutorial in rasa 
	showcasing this, but this has been deprecated so we can not use those steps

2. We can create custom connectors for assistant like google assistant 
	1. these connectors will act like webhook
	2. but if assistant themselves can't call these webhooks the they are of no use.
3. The next alternative was Google Developer Console
	1. But these are coupled with Google Home Devices
	2. They are trying to build on device layer
